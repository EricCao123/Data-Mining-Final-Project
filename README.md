# Data-Mining-Final-Project
Python program that classifies book into age appropriateness and hate speech recognition

The file called Final Report is our final report.


To run the programs, please restart and run all cells. It might take a couple minutes before it's finished.
The Project folder contains all of our code and data sets, dictionaries, and books.
    	main,ipynb is a python notebook for reading books, writing to .csv files, and anything else that is not graphs.
    	database.py is a python class file that contains all the functions for reading books, writing books, and anything that is not graphs.
    	the Books folder contains 100 books all in .txt format downloaded from Project Gutenberg.

    	The Data folder contains all the data results. 
		The first folder contains .csv files for every book in the Book folder. In this file there is a folder for every author with their own respective .csv files. 
			In these author files are book folders for every book by that author with their own respective .csv folders.

The Graphs folder contains all of the graphs shown in the report.
	final bar chart contains code that will display all bar charts.
